# Secured Login System

A secured login system built using **React** for the frontend, **Flask** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** for the database, and **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication.

---

## Features

- **User Registration**: Securely register new users.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users using JWT.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Manage permissions for different user roles.
- **Token Management**: Generate, validate, and revoke JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms.

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.

### Backend
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for handling backend logic and API endpoints.

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database for storing user data.

### Authentication
- **JWT**: For secure and stateless user authentication.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (for React)
- **Python** (for Flask)
- **PostgreSQL** (for the database)

### Backend Setup (Flask)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secured-login.git
   cd secured-login/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the database:
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials.

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register a new user or log in with existing credentials.
3. Use the application features based on your assigned role.

## Security Measures
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using secure algorithms before being stored in the database.
- **JWT Expiry**: Tokens have an expiration time to minimize unauthorized access.
- **CORS**: Configured to restrict API access to trusted domains.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configurations are stored in `.env` files.

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Add support for social login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- Include email verification during registration.
- Integrate logging and monitoring for better security insights.
